        About Us
    </h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia:</p>
    <blockquote><p>A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Hobart Hackerspace Inc. was founded in 2012 after a successful crowd funding campaign which was designed to not only raise money, but to also gauge the interest in opening a dedicated community workshop dedicated to technology and art. After many months of searching, a license was signed with the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services to utilise one of the guardhouses at 2 St Johns Ave, New Town, on the edge of the former St Johns Park orphanage.</p>
	<p>We are still in this building, though quickly outgrowing it so have begun the search for a new home, hopefully with higher ceilings and more open spaces.</p>
	<p>Visitors are welcome on Thursday nights from 7pm, however, you will be asked to join after a few visits as we are currently funded entirely through membership fees.</p>
	<p>For more information, please use the contact form to get in touch with members of the management committee.</p>
